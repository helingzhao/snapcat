In the realm of ones and zeros, where dreams take flight,
I embarked on a coding quest, both day and night,
To connect a motion sensor, camera, and Pi so neat,
Capturing feline moments, a project quite a feat.

With Raspberry Pi as my trusty guide,
I forged a bridge, a digital divide,
A sensor keen to motion's subtle sway,
A camera lens, to seize the moment's play.

In lines of code, I wove a tale,
A narrative of sensors, never to fail,
To snap a photo, when whiskers whisked the air,
A cat's enchanting presence, beyond compare.

But this endeavor, it did not cease,
For the photo alone would not bring peace,
A server code awakened on my computer's core,
To check if 'twas my feline I adored.

TensorFlow, a wizard of AI might,
Analyze the image, in its pixelated light,
To seek the telltale signs, the furry grace,
Of my beloved cat's enchanting face.

And if it found a match, a purr of delight,
A message sent, to take to flight,
To **Twitter's realm, where moments spread their wings,
My cat's portrait, to the world it brings.

A symphony of code, a digital ballet,
Motion, image, model, all in perfect array,
The project came to life, a masterpiece in code,
Capturing my cat's essence, in every single node.

In the world of coding, where dreams take flight,
This project, a beacon, a shimmering light,
A fusion of technology and feline art,
Forever in my heart, a work of love from the start.

**2023 Update: Twitter is now X isn't it?

Thanks ChatGPT

In the realm of ones and zeros, where dreams take flight,<br>
I embarked on a coding quest, both day and night,<br>
To connect a motion sensor, camera, and Pi so neat,<br>
Capturing feline moments, a project quite a feat.<br><br>

With Raspberry Pi as my trusty guide,<br>
I forged a bridge, a digital divide,<br>
A sensor keen to motion's subtle sway,<br>
A camera lens, to seize the moment's play.<br><br>

In lines of code, I wove a tale,<br>
A narrative of sensors, never to fail,<br>
To snap a photo, when whiskers whisked the air,<br>
A cat's enchanting presence, beyond compare.<br><br>

But this endeavor, it did not cease,<br>
For the photo alone would not bring peace,<br>
A server code awakened on my computer's core,<br>
To check if 'twas my feline I adored.<br><br>

TensorFlow, a wizard of AI might,<br>
Analyze the image, in its pixelated light,<br>
To seek the telltale signs, the furry grace,<br>
Of my beloved cat's enchanting face.<br><br>

And if it found a match, a purr of delight,<br>
A message sent, to take to flight,<br>
To **Twitter's realm, where moments spread their wings,<br>
My cat's portrait, to the world it brings.<br><br>

A symphony of code, a digital ballet,<br>
Motion, image, model, all in perfect array,<br>
The project came to life, a masterpiece in code,<br>
Capturing my cat's essence, in every single node.<br><br>

In the world of coding, where dreams take flight,<br>
This project, a beacon, a shimmering light,<br>
A fusion of technology and feline art,<br>
Forever in my heart, a work of love from the start.<br><br>

**2023 Update: Twitter is now X isn't it?
